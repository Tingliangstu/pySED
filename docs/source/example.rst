Example
=======

**pySED** provides a number of `examples <https://github.com/Tingliangstu/pySED/tree/main/example>`_ to help users learn how to use **pySED** efficiently.

Currently, we recommend that users start by learning how to generate SED data for :math:`\text{MoS}_2` using **pySED** and **GPUMD**. 
This example is well integrated with the latest version of the software and serves as a comprehensive guide.

You can find the :math:`\text{MoS}_2` example here:
