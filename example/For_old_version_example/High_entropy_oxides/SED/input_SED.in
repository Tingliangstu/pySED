#lorentz_fit_cutoff = 2               # if not set, lorentz fitting figure will plot all-range frequency according the FFT, if set frequency will cutoff (THz), one can set plot_cutoff_freq = lorentz_fit_cutoff (maybe very useful for some strong anharmonicity systems)
modulate_factor =  10                 # If set (int), the fitting of a single peak will shrink the fitting range of the X-axis (THz) toward the middle, which helps to get a better phonon lifetime (default=0)        
lorentz_fit_all_qpoint = 1            # Fit all qpoints peak and output the phonon lifetime for the systems in the unit of ps

# Tips
# 1. The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the surrounding baseline
#    of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance between the peak and its lowest contour line.
# 2. Using 'lorentz_fit_cutoff', 'modulate_factor' flag will help a lot for fitting phonon lifetime
# 3. If it is not fitting well for single Q point, one can use the 're_output_total_freq_lifetime' flag and adjust
     'peak_height' and 'peak_prominence', and pySED will reoutput the TOTAL-LORENTZ-Qpoints.Fre_lifetime file.
