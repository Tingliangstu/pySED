re_output_total_freq_lifetime = 0  # This parameter allows you to re-adjust the single peak of a single q point and re-output the TOTAL phonon lifetime (set lorentz_fit_all_qpoint=0)

# ************ Do Lorentz fitting for all q points************
lorentz_fit_all_qpoint = 1    # Fit all qpoints peak and output the phonon lifetime for the systems in the unit of ps

# Tips
# 1. The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the surrounding baseline
#    of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance between the peak and its lowest contour line.
# 2. Using 'lorentz_fit_cutoff', 'modulate_factor' flag will help a lot for fitting phonon lifetime
# 3. If it is not fitting well for single Q point, one can use the 're_output_total_freq_lifetime' flag and adjust
     'peak_height' and 'peak_prominence', and pySED will reoutput the TOTAL-LORENTZ-Qpoints.Fre_lifetime file.
