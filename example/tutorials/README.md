# A pySED jupyter Tutorial: Calculating Spectral Energy Density (SED) for MoS<sub>2<sub/>

This guide walks you through using **pySED** to compute the **Spectral Energy Density (SED)** of a **MoS<sub>2<sub/>** system entirely in **GPUMD**.

It is strongly recommended that you reproduce this tutorial **exactly** before applying the method to your own system.
