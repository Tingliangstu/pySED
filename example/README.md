# Example to use the pySED to calculate the SED of Silicon
 
** It is best to reproduce the results of examples before calculating one's system. **
 
** Replicating the Aluminum and Silicon examples is highly recommended. In `(Ref) Phonon_dispersion_from_phonopy` folder, the lattice dynamics (LD) method can be used to calculate the phonon dispersion and verify the reliability of the SED method. **
