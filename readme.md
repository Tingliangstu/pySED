#pySED
===========
To implement the phonon SED (spectral energy desity) method in 2010, phonon lifetime can be calculated  

##Main features
-------------
- Output SED image 
- Using Lorentz to fitting the SED peak 
- Fit all peaks at once and output phonon lifetimes, or can fit them individually
- Simple and easy to use
- Phonon lifetime can only be obtained qualitatively

#Installation instructions
--------------------------

1) From source code
```python
# python setup.py install --user --prefix=
```

For convenience, you may want to copy (or link) the files inside scripts
folder to a location included in $PATH environment variable

## Usage

Here three example are provided to show how to use **pySED**. 
If one can reproduce the case in the example, one should use the program.

If I have the time, I might provide a detailed tutorial manual.
